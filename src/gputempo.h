// GPU time per frame, measured by the GPU itself (GL_EXT_disjoint_timer_query).
//
// Why: on Android TV the only numbers we had for a slow frame were CPU waits
// (`clr` and `swap` in [quadro]), and vsync quantizes those: a GPU frame of
// 17 ms and one of 30 ms both show up as "33 ms", and 45 / 40 / 30 fps say
// "over budget" without saying by how much. Measured on the TCL Smart TV Pro
// (Mali-G52, 06/10/2026): the home at 40 fps and the profile picker at 45 fps
// both looked identical in [quadro], and removing a 0.28-screen veil was the
// difference between 45 and 60 — invisible in every number we logged.
//
// One timer query brackets the whole frame (texture uploads, draw, the final
// swap excluded: that is the compositor). Results are read a few frames later,
// never blocking; a GPU_DISJOINT event throws the window away.
//
// Android only for now: the Mali/Adreno/PowerVR drivers there expose the
// extension on ES2 contexts; the webOS build is WebGL (no timer queries) and
// the .tpk is not measured here. Everywhere else every function is a no-op
// and gputempo_colher returns 0.
